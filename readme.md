# The Box Model: Davie's Burgers

In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional restaurant’s website. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, but the box model properties have yet to be set. You’ll use knowledge of height, width, padding, border, and margin to complete this project.

The website’s existing index.html and style.css files are displayed in the text editor to the right. As you work, use both to see which elements you are selecting and styling. Most of the elements that you’ll need to add styles for already have rule sets in style.css to which you can add additional declarations.
